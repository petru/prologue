	<h1>Hi there!</h1>
	<p>You've reached my personal website. Now that you're here, make yourself at home. There's not much to look at (for now), but things are slowly moving along.</p>
	<p>The design is based off a pre-existing theme and it's being updated continuously as I try out new things and iron out bugs.</p>
	<p>You'll find a list of blogposts below soon enough.</p>
	{% for post in site.posts %}
		{% unless post.next %}
			<h3 class="code">{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}</h3>
		{% else %}
			{% capture year %}{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
			{% capture nyear %}{{ post.next.date | date: '%Y' }}{% endcapture %}
			{% if year != nyear %}
				<h3 class="code">{{ post.date | date: '%Y' }}</h3>
			{% endif %}
		{% endunless %}

		<ul>
			<li>
				<div class="post-date code">
					<span>{{ post.date | date: "%b %d" }}</span>
				</div>
				<div class="title">
					<a href="{{ post.url | prepend: site.baseurl | prepend: site.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a>
				</div>
			</li>
		</ul>
